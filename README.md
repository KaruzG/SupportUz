Tickering Web App. Create **companies, users, support users** and manage the tickets created by users. 

## Where we aim
We want to make an open source tickering web app easy to install in any server and customizable. Manage tickets from 1 companie or multiple, get alerts via mail/telegram of events, and more.
Right now is an early proyect so new ideas will arrive ðŸ˜‰.
